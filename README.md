nand2os
=======

nand2os is a small project that I am trying today. The idea is inspired from the 'nandtotetris' project. I want to start from a NAND gate and build a basic computer from it and then write a basic OS for this computer.  I am trying to do things in C programming. My motivation is to learn and improve C Programming and in the process of learning, understand some fundamentals about computers.
